# GitHub Actions Workflow: Rename SpecLinter Directories
#
# Purpose: Automatically rename .speclinter and speclinter-tasks directories to 
#          .speclinter-example and speclinter-tasks-example when code is pushed 
#          to the main branch. This prevents conflicts for users cloning the repo.
#
# Security: Only runs for the repository owner (orangebread) and not on forks
# Triggers: Push events to the main branch only
# Permissions: Minimal - only contents:write for committing changes

name: Rename SpecLinter Directories

# Trigger only on pushes to main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# Minimal permissions - only what's needed for the task
permissions:
  contents: write
