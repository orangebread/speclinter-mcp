# Task: Implement Directory Detection Logic

**ID**: task_02
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: github-action-directory-rename

## Summary
Add steps to detect if .speclinter and speclinter-tasks directories exist

## Implementation Details
Use shell commands with &#x27;test -d&#x27; to check directory existence. Set GitHub Actions output variables using echo &#x27;name&#x3D;value&#x27; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Include conditional logic to skip if -example directories already exist.

## Patterns to Follow
- Bash scripting within GitHub Actions: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#bash-scripting-within-github-actions`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Checks for existence of .speclinter/ directory
- [ ] Checks for existence of speclinter-tasks/ directory
- [ ] Skips processing if directories already have -example suffix
- [ ] Sets output variables for subsequent steps
- [ ] Logs detection results for debugging

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/implement-directory-detection-logic.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test with various directory states: existing, missing, already renamed
