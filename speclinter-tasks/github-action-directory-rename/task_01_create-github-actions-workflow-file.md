# Task: Create GitHub Actions Workflow File

**ID**: task_01
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: github-action-directory-rename

## Summary
Set up the main workflow file with proper triggers and security checks

## Implementation Details
Create a YAML workflow file using GitHub Actions syntax. Use &#x27;on.push.branches: [main]&#x27; trigger and add conditional checks using &#x27;if: github.actor &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;orangebread&#x27; &amp;&amp; github.repository_owner &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;orangebread&#x27;&#x27;. Set up minimal token permissions with &#x27;contents: write&#x27; only.

## Patterns to Follow
- GitHub Actions YAML: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#github-actions-yaml`
- CI/CD patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#ci-cd-patterns`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflow file created at .github/workflows/rename-speclinter-dirs.yml
- [ ] Triggers only on push to main branch
- [ ] Includes actor check for &#x27;orangebread&#x27; user
- [ ] Includes fork detection to prevent running on forks
- [ ] Uses appropriate GitHub token permissions

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/create-github-actions-workflow-file.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test by creating a test push to main branch and verifying workflow triggers only for correct user
