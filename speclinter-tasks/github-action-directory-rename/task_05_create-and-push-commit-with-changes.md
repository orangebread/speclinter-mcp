# Task: Create and Push Commit with Changes

**ID**: task_05
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: github-action-directory-rename

## Summary
Commit the renamed directories and push back to repository

## Implementation Details
Use &#x27;git add .&#x27; to stage changes, then &#x27;git diff --staged --quiet&#x27; to check if changes exist. Only commit if changes are present. Use &#x27;git commit -m&#x27; with the specified message and &#x27;git push origin main&#x27; to push changes.

## Patterns to Follow
- Git operations with GitHub Actions token authentication: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#git-operations-with-github-actions-token-authentication`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Creates commit only if directories were actually renamed
- [ ] Uses commit message &#x27;chore: rename SpecLinter directories to examples [skip ci]&#x27;
- [ ] Includes [skip ci] flag to prevent infinite loops
- [ ] Pushes changes back to main branch
- [ ] Handles case where no changes were made gracefully

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/create-and-push-commit-with-changes.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test commit creation and push operations, verify [skip ci] works
