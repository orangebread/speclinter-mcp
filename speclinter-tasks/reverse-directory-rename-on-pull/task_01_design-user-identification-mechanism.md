# Task: Design User Identification Mechanism

**ID**: task_01
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: reverse-directory-rename-on-pull

## Summary
Create a reliable method to identify when the repository owner (orangebread) is performing operations

## Implementation Details
Use Git configuration to check user.name or user.email. Create a shell function that checks &#x27;git config user.name&#x27; or &#x27;git config user.email&#x27; against known values for orangebread. Consider environment variables as fallback.

## Patterns to Follow
- Shell scripting patterns for Git operations: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#shell-scripting-patterns-for-git-operations`
- Secure user identification without hardcoded credentials: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#secure-user-identification-without-hardcoded-credentials`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function correctly identifies orangebread user
- [ ] Works across different Git configurations
- [ ] Fails safely for other users
- [ ] Does not expose sensitive information

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/design-user-identification-mechanism.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test with different Git configurations and user settings
