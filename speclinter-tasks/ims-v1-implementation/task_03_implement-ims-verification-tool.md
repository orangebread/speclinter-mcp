# Task: Implement IMS Verification Tool

**ID**: task_03
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: ims-v1-implementation

## Summary
Create MCP tool for validating existing manifests and verifying implementation integrity

## Implementation Details
Add verify_ims_manifest tool to src/ai-tools.ts with prepare/process pattern. Implement manifest schema validation using created Zod schemas. Add file hash verification by recalculating SHA-256 hashes and comparing with manifest values. Integrate with test runner to validate coverage metrics. Implement chain integrity checking by verifying chain.previous hash references.

## Patterns to Follow
- Validation patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#validation-patterns`
- Error handling patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#error-handling-patterns`
- Hash verification patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#hash-verification-patterns`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validates manifests against IMS v0.1.0 schema
- [ ] Verifies file hashes match current implementation state
- [ ] Validates test coverage metrics when available
- [ ] Checks manifest chain integrity for evolution tracking
- [ ] Returns detailed verification results with specific failure reasons
- [ ] Handles missing files and broken chain references gracefully

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/implement-ims-verification-tool.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test verification with valid and invalid manifests, test with real manifest files and code changes, test with corrupted manifests, missing files, and broken chains
