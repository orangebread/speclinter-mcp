Feature: Register IMS Tools in MCP Server
  Integrate IMS tools into SpecLinter MCP server architecture

  Scenario: Successfully register ims tools in mcp server
    Given the system is properly configured
    And all prerequisites are met
    When I integrate ims tools into speclinter mcp server architecture
    Then ims tools are properly registered in mcp server
    And the operation should complete successfully
    And appropriate feedback should be provided

  Scenario: Handle errors during register ims tools in mcp server
    Given the system is available
    When I integrate ims tools into speclinter mcp server architecture with invalid data
    Then an appropriate error message should be displayed
    And the system should remain stable
    And the user should be guided on how to correct the issue

  Scenario: Handle edge cases for register ims tools in mcp server
    Given the system is under normal operation
    When I integrate ims tools into speclinter mcp server architecture with boundary values
    Then the system should handle the edge case gracefully
    And appropriate validation should be applied
    And the result should be consistent with business rules

  Scenario: Validate input for register ims tools in mcp server
    Given the system is ready to accept input
    When I provide invalid or malformed data
    Then input validation should be triggered
    And specific validation errors should be shown
    And the user should understand what needs to be corrected

# Testing Notes:
# - Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered
# - Consider integration with existing system components
# - Test with realistic data and edge cases
# - Validate error handling and user feedback
