Feature: Implement IMS Query Tool
  Create MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests

  Scenario: Successfully implement ims query tool
    Given the system is properly configured
    And all prerequisites are met
    When I MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests
    Then search manifests by requirement id, agent, or implementation status
    And the operation should complete successfully
    And appropriate feedback should be provided

  Scenario: Handle errors during implement ims query tool
    Given the system is available
    When I MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests with invalid data
    Then an appropriate error message should be displayed
    And the system should remain stable
    And the user should be guided on how to correct the issue

  Scenario: Handle edge cases for implement ims query tool
    Given the system is under normal operation
    When I MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests with boundary values
    Then the system should handle the edge case gracefully
    And appropriate validation should be applied
    And the result should be consistent with business rules

# Testing Notes:
# - Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered
# - Consider integration with existing system components
# - Test with realistic data and edge cases
# - Validate error handling and user feedback
