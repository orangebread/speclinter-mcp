# Task: Implement IMS Manifest Creation Tool

**ID**: task_02
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: ims-v1-implementation

## Summary
Create MCP tool for generating IMS v0.1.0 compliant manifest files with automatic code analysis

## Implementation Details
Add create_ims_manifest tool to src/ai-tools.ts following two-step pattern. Implement handleCreateIMSManifestPrepare for data collection and handleProcessIMSManifestCreation for manifest generation. Use existing file analysis patterns from codebase-analyzer.ts for symbol extraction. Integrate with crypto module for SHA-256 file hashing. Store manifests in .speclinter/manifests directory using StorageManager patterns.

## Patterns to Follow
- Two-step AI tool pattern: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#two-step-ai-tool-pattern`
- File analysis patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#file-analysis-patterns`
- StorageManager integration: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#storagemanager-integration`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tool generates valid IMS v0.1.0 manifest files
- [ ] Automatic extraction of file symbols, hashes, and line numbers
- [ ] Integration with test coverage data when available
- [ ] Manifest files stored in proper .speclinter directory structure
- [ ] Tool follows SpecLinter two-step AI pattern
- [ ] Proper error handling for file access and analysis failures

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/implement-ims-manifest-creation-tool.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test manifest creation with various file types and structures, test integration with StorageManager and file system, test with binary files, empty files, and permission-denied scenarios
