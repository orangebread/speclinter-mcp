# Task: Extend StorageManager for IMS Support

**ID**: task_05
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: ims-v1-implementation

## Summary
Enhance SpecLinter StorageManager to handle IMS manifest storage and indexing

## Implementation Details
Extend src/core/storage-manager.ts to create .speclinter/manifests directory structure. Add methods for manifest CRUD operations, indexing, and querying. Implement manifest file naming conventions and organization. Add git integration for manifest versioning and history tracking. Create manifest index for efficient querying.

## Patterns to Follow
- Storage abstraction patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#storage-abstraction-patterns`
- File system patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#file-system-patterns`
- Git integration patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#git-integration-patterns`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StorageManager creates proper manifest directory structure
- [ ] Manifest CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Manifest indexing enables efficient querying
- [ ] Git integration tracks manifest changes
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing SpecLinter storage
- [ ] Proper error handling for storage operations

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/extend-storagemanager-for-ims-support.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test storage operations with various manifest types, test with existing SpecLinter storage workflows, test with disk space limitations and permission issues
