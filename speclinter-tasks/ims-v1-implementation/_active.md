## Tasks

### ⏳ Create IMS Schema Definitions (task_01)
Implement comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all IMS v0.1.0 fields following SpecLinter patterns

**Next Steps**: Create src/types/ims-schemas.ts with Zod schemas for IMSManifestSchema, IMSRequirementSchema, IMSAgentSchema, IMSImplementationSchema, IMSVerificationSchema, IMSRelationshipsSchema, IMSChainSchema, IMSMetaSchema, and IMSExtensionsSchema. Follow existing patterns in src/types/ai-schemas.ts for schema structure and validation. Include comprehensive field descriptions and validation rules matching IMS v0.1.0 specification exactly.

### ⏳ Implement IMS Manifest Creation Tool (task_02)
Create MCP tool for generating IMS v0.1.0 compliant manifest files with automatic code analysis

**Next Steps**: Add create_ims_manifest tool to src/ai-tools.ts following two-step pattern. Implement handleCreateIMSManifestPrepare for data collection and handleProcessIMSManifestCreation for manifest generation. Use existing file analysis patterns from codebase-analyzer.ts for symbol extraction. Integrate with crypto module for SHA-256 file hashing. Store manifests in .speclinter/manifests directory using StorageManager patterns.

### ⏳ Implement IMS Verification Tool (task_03)
Create MCP tool for validating existing manifests and verifying implementation integrity

**Next Steps**: Add verify_ims_manifest tool to src/ai-tools.ts with prepare/process pattern. Implement manifest schema validation using created Zod schemas. Add file hash verification by recalculating SHA-256 hashes and comparing with manifest values. Integrate with test runner to validate coverage metrics. Implement chain integrity checking by verifying chain.previous hash references.

### ⏳ Implement IMS Query Tool (task_04)
Create MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests

**Next Steps**: Add query_ims_manifests tool to src/ai-tools.ts following SpecLinter patterns. Implement manifest indexing in StorageManager for efficient querying by requirement ID, agent, status, and relationships. Create query builders for complex searches including dependency tracking and evolution queries. Generate traceability reports linking requirements to code implementations.

### ⏳ Extend StorageManager for IMS Support (task_05)
Enhance SpecLinter StorageManager to handle IMS manifest storage and indexing

**Next Steps**: Extend src/core/storage-manager.ts to create .speclinter/manifests directory structure. Add methods for manifest CRUD operations, indexing, and querying. Implement manifest file naming conventions and organization. Add git integration for manifest versioning and history tracking. Create manifest index for efficient querying.

### ⏳ Register IMS Tools in MCP Server (task_06)
Integrate IMS tools into SpecLinter MCP server architecture

**Next Steps**: Add IMS tool registrations to src/server.ts following existing patterns. Update tool schemas and descriptions for MCP protocol. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting. Add IMS tools to documentation and help systems. Test MCP integration with AI IDE clients.
