# Task: Implement IMS Query Tool

**ID**: task_04
**Status**: ‚è≥ not_started
**Feature**: ims-v1-implementation

## Summary
Create MCP tool for searching and reporting on implementation manifests

## Implementation Details
Add query_ims_manifests tool to src/ai-tools.ts following SpecLinter patterns. Implement manifest indexing in StorageManager for efficient querying by requirement ID, agent, status, and relationships. Create query builders for complex searches including dependency tracking and evolution queries. Generate traceability reports linking requirements to code implementations.

## Patterns to Follow
- Query builder patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#query-builder-patterns`
- Indexing patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#indexing-patterns`
- Report generation patterns: See `.speclinter/context/patterns.md#report-generation-patterns`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search manifests by requirement ID, agent, or implementation status
- [ ] Find implementation dependencies and relationships
- [ ] Generate traceability reports linking requirements to code
- [ ] Support manifest evolution queries through chain references
- [ ] Return structured query results with relevant metadata
- [ ] Handle large manifest collections efficiently

## Test Coverage
- **Gherkin**: `gherkin/implement-ims-query-tool.feature`
- **Target**: 90%

## Implementation Notes
Test query functionality with various search criteria, test with large collections of manifests, test with empty results, malformed queries, and concurrent access
