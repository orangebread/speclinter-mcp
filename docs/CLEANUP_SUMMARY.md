# 🧹 Production Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Cleanup Tasks Completed

We have successfully performed all minor cleanup tasks to make the AI-leveraged SpecLinter fully production-ready.

## 🔧 Issues Addressed

### 1. Test Expectations Fixed ✅
**Issue**: Test assertions didn't match actual AI prompt text
**Solution**: Updated test expectations to match the enhanced AI prompt templates

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed `handleAnalyzeCodebaseAI` test to expect "Analyze the provided codebase files"
- Fixed `handleParseSpecAI` test to expect "Analyze the provided specification"  
- Fixed `handleFindSimilarAI` test to expect "determine semantic similarity"
- Added proper type safety with optional chaining for test assertions

### 2. Missing Test Coverage Added ✅
**Issue**: No tests for similarity analysis tools
**Solution**: Added comprehensive tests for AI similarity analysis workflow

**New Tests Added**:
- `handleFindSimilarAI` - Tests similarity analysis prompt generation
- `handleProcessSimilarityAnalysisAI` - Tests AI similarity result processing
- Edge cases: No existing features, invalid AI responses
- Integration with storage layer for feature comparison

### 3. Unused Dependencies Removed ✅
**Issue**: `@xenova/transformers` dependency not used anywhere in codebase
**Solution**: Removed from package.json dependencies

**Impact**: Cleaner dependency tree, reduced bundle size

### 4. Documentation Cleaned ✅
**Issue**: References to removed hybrid tools in documentation
**Solution**: Updated documentation to reflect AI-first approach

**Changes Made**:
- Removed hybrid tool references from `docs/AI_REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md`
- Updated README.md to focus on AI-leveraged tools
- Clarified that implementation doesn't maintain backwards compatibility
- Enhanced focus on clean AI-first architecture

### 5. AI Prompt Templates Enhanced ✅
**Issue**: AI prompt templates lacked detailed examples and instructions
**Solution**: Added comprehensive guidance for better AI analysis

**Enhancements Made**:
- **Codebase Analysis**: Detailed instructions for tech stack detection, pattern recognition, quality assessment
- **Spec Analysis**: Step-by-step guidance for task breakdown, quality scoring, scope definition
- **Similarity Analysis**: Clear instructions for semantic comparison and recommendation logic
