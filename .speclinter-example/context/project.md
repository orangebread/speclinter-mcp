# Project Context

## Project Overview
**SpecLinter MCP** is an AI-leveraged specification analysis and task generation system that transforms natural language specifications into structured, implementable tasks with built-in quality gates.

## Domain & Purpose
- **Domain**: Developer tooling and AI-assisted software development
- **Core Problem**: Converting vague specifications into actionable development tasks
- **Solution**: AI-powered analysis that breaks down specs into structured tasks with quality grading
- **Value Proposition**: Bridges the gap between requirements and implementation through intelligent task decomposition

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Software developers working with AI IDEs (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf)
- **Secondary**: Development teams needing structured task management
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Feature specification analysis and breakdown
  - Quality assessment of requirements
  - Task generation with acceptance criteria
  - Implementation validation against specifications

## Technology Stack

### Core Infrastructure
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type safety
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ for modern JavaScript features
- **Architecture**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 for local data persistence
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: TypeScript compiler (tsc)
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration testing
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (recommended) for efficient dependency management

### AI Integration
- **Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI IDE integration
- **Transport**: stdio for communication with AI systems
- **Analysis**: AI-powered specification parsing and quality assessment
- **Context**: Dynamic project context generation for better AI assistance

## Key Domain Concepts

### Specifications
Natural language descriptions of features or requirements that need to be implemented.

### Quality Grading
A+ to F grading system that evaluates specification quality based on:
- Clarity and specificity
- Completeness of requirements
- Presence of acceptance criteria
- Technical feasibility

### Task Generation
Breaking down specifications into implementable tasks with:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependency relationships
- Effort estimates
- Gherkin scenarios for testing

### Feature Similarity
AI-powered semantic analysis to detect duplicate or similar features to prevent redundant work.

### Implementation Validation
AI assessment of code implementation against original specifications and generated tasks.

## Architectural Decisions

### MCP Server Architecture
- **Decision**: Use MCP server architecture for AI IDE integration
- **Context**: Need to integrate with multiple AI IDEs (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf)
- **Rationale**: MCP provides standardized protocol for AI tool integration
- **Benefits**: Universal compatibility, standardized communication, future-proof
- **Trade-offs**: Limited to stdio transport, requires MCP-compatible clients

### SQLite Database
- **Decision**: Use SQLite for local data persistence
- **Context**: Need to store feature data, tasks, and similarity analysis
- **Rationale**: Local-first approach, no external dependencies, excellent performance
- **Benefits**: Zero-config, ACID compliance, excellent TypeScript integration
- **Trade-offs**: Single-user, not suitable for distributed systems

### TypeScript with Zod
- **Decision**: Full TypeScript with Zod validation
- **Context**: Need runtime type safety for AI-generated data
- **Rationale**: AI responses are unpredictable, need validation at runtime
- **Benefits**: Compile-time and runtime safety, excellent developer experience
- **Trade-offs**: Additional complexity, larger bundle size

### Directory-Based Task Storage
- **Decision**: Store tasks in filesystem directories rather than database
- **Context**: Need human-readable, version-controllable task storage
- **Rationale**: Git integration, easy inspection, collaborative editing
- **Benefits**: Version control, human-readable, easy backup
- **Trade-offs**: More complex querying, potential file system limitations

## Development Workflow

### Project Initialization
1. Run `speclinter_init_project` to create directory structure
2. AI analyzes codebase to generate context files
3. Configuration created with sensible defaults

### Feature Development
1. Parse specification with `speclinter_parse_spec_prepare`
2. AI analyzes and grades specification quality
3. Generate structured tasks with `speclinter_parse_spec_process`
4. Implement tasks following generated acceptance criteria
5. Validate implementation with `speclinter_validate_implementation`

### Quality Assurance
- Continuous quality grading of specifications
- Similarity detection to prevent duplicate work
- Implementation validation against original requirements
- Gherkin scenario generation for testing guidance

## Integration Patterns

### AI IDE Integration
- MCP server provides tools to AI assistants
- Bidirectional communication for analysis and feedback
- Context-aware responses based on project analysis

### Version Control Integration
- Git-friendly directory structure
- Human-readable task files
- Collaborative editing support

### Development Tool Integration
- CLI commands for standalone usage
- Package.json scripts for build automation
- TypeScript for IDE support

## Constraints & Standards

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js 18+ required for modern JavaScript features
- MCP protocol limitations (stdio transport only)
- SQLite single-user limitations
- File system-based storage constraints

### Quality Standards
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- Zod validation for all external data
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive testing with Vitest

### Development Standards
- Conventional commit messages
- ESLint code quality rules
- Structured logging with appropriate levels
- Clear separation of concerns (core, tools, storage)

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Current architecture supports single-user, local development
- Future: Multi-user support would require database migration
- Future: Distributed analysis for large codebases

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom analysis patterns
- Additional AI model support beyond MCP
- Custom quality grading criteria
- Integration with external project management tools
