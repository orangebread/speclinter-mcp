## 🎯 Core Workflows

### Scenario: Developer Gets Quality Feedback on Vague Spec
```gherkin
Given I have a vague specification: "Add social features"
When I ask SpecLinter to parse it
Then I get grade F with specific improvement suggestions
And actionable feedback like "Define specific social features"
And a template showing how to improve to grade A
```

### Scenario: Developer Generates Structured Tasks
```gherkin
Given I have a detailed spec: "Create user authentication with email verification, password reset, and 2FA"
When SpecLinter analyzes it
Then I get grade A with 8-12 structured tasks
And each task has acceptance criteria and Gherkin scenarios
And tasks are saved in organized directories
```

### Scenario: Developer Validates Implementation
```gherkin
Given I've implemented my authentication feature
When I ask SpecLinter to validate it
Then AI scans my codebase for related files
And compares implementation against original spec
And provides quality score with specific recommendations
```

### Scenario: Team Avoids Duplicate Work
```gherkin
Given my teammate built user profile management
When I try to add "user settings page"
Then SpecLinter detects 85% similarity
And recommends extending existing feature
And prevents duplicate implementation
```

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** • **pnpm** (recommended)

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

### MCP Integration

| AI IDE | Configuration File | Location |

| **Cursor** | `mcp_servers.json` | `~/.cursor/` |
| **Claude Desktop** | `claude_desktop_config.json` | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` (macOS)<br>`%APPDATA%\Claude\` (Windows) |
| **Windsurf** | Check Windsurf docs | Varies |

**Add this configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speclinter": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/speclinter-mcp/dist/cli.js", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ✅ Verify Setup
```bash
# Test server starts
node dist/cli.js serve

# In your AI IDE, try:
"Initialize SpecLinter in my project"
"Parse this spec: Create a user login form"
```

### 📖 GitMCP Integration
For documentation access and examples, you can also add GitMCP integration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "speclinter-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://gitmcp.io/orangebread/speclinter-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
This provides AI access to SpecLinter documentation and usage examples.

## 📊 Quality System

SpecLinter grades your specifications and provides actionable feedback:

| Grade | Score | What It Means | Example Issues |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 🏆 **A+** | 95-100 | Exceptional spec | None - ready to implement |
| ⭐ **A** | 90-94 | Excellent spec | Minor clarity improvements |
| ✅ **B** | 80-89 | Good spec | Missing some acceptance criteria |
| ⚠️ **C** | 70-79 | Needs work | Vague terms, brief description |
| ❌ **D** | 60-69 | Poor spec | Major gaps in requirements |
| 🚫 **F** | 0-59 | Failing spec | Too vague to implement |

### Quality Criteria Checklist
- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria** - What defines "done"?
- ✅ **Specific requirements** - Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly"
- ✅ **Error handling** - What happens when things go wrong?
- ✅ **Sufficient detail** - Enough info for implementation
- ✅ **User story format** - "As a... I want... So that..." (optional)

### Example: F → A Transformation

**❌ Grade F Spec:**
```
"Add social features to the app"
```

**✅ Grade A Spec:**
```
As a user, I want to send direct messages to other users so that I can communicate privately.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can search for other users by username
- Messages are delivered in real-time using WebSocket
- Message history is preserved and searchable
- Users can block/unblock other users
- All messages are encrypted end-to-end

Error Handling:
- Show "User not found" for invalid usernames
- Display "Message failed to send" with retry option
- Handle offline users with message queuing
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 🧪 AI-Powered Gherkin Scenarios
Every task gets comprehensive, actionable test scenarios with enhanced AI generation:
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication System
  Implement secure user login and registration with email verification

  Scenario: Successfully authenticate user with valid credentials
    Given the user registration system is available
    And a user exists with email "user@example.com" and password "SecurePass123"
    When I submit login form with valid credentials
    Then the user should be authenticated successfully
    And a JWT token should be generated and returned
    And the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And the login attempt should be logged

  Scenario: Handle invalid login attempts
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
    When I submit login form with email "user@example.com" and password "WrongPassword"
    Then the authentication should be rejected
    And an error message "Invalid credentials" should be displayed
    And no JWT token should be generated
    And the failed attempt should be logged

  Scenario: Validate input format during login
    Given the login system is ready to accept input
    When I provide malformed email "invalid-email" and password "test123"
    Then input validation should be triggered
    And specific validation errors should be shown
    And the user should understand what needs to be corrected
```

**🎯 Enhanced Scenario Features:**
- **AI-Generated Quality**: Scenarios tailored to your project's tech stack and patterns
- **Multiple Types**: Happy path, error handling, edge cases, security, and performance scenarios
- **Specific Data**: Concrete examples instead of generic placeholders
- **Actionable Steps**: Each step can be implemented as an automated test
- **Business Focus**: User-centric language with technical accuracy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All acceptance criteria addressed
- **Configurable Complexity**: Adjust scenario depth and coverage via configuration

### 🔍 Semantic Similarity Detection
Prevents duplicate work by finding similar features:
```
Input: "user profile management"
Found: "user settings page" (85% similarity)
Recommendation: Extend existing feature
```

### 🤖 AI Implementation Validation
Advanced AI-powered validation that understands your code:
- **Intelligent Codebase Scanning** - Finds implementation files using semantic analysis
- **Context-Aware Analysis** - Understands your project's patterns and tech stack
- **Quality Assessment** - Provides detailed scoring with specific recommendations

```

### Cross-Project Similarity
SpecLinter can detect similar features across multiple repositories and microservices, helping large teams avoid redundant work.

## 🔧 Development & Contributing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orangebread/speclinter-mcp.git
cd speclinter-mcp

# Traditional development
pnpm install && pnpm build

# Available scripts
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm test         # Run Vitest tests (implementation validation)
pnpm lint         # Lint code with ESLint
